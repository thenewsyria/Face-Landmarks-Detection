# 🏆 Face Landmarks Detection 🎯  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **detecting facial landmarks (key points)** using **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Deep Learning (CNNs)**. It employs **OpenCV for face detection** and **a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model** to predict key facial points like eyes, nose, and mouth.  

### 🌟 Features  
✅ **Automatic Face Detection** using OpenCV’s Haar cascades.  
✅ **Facial Keypoint Detection** with a CNN model trained on annotated face datasets.  
✅ **Pre-processing techniques** (grayscale conversion, normalization, and image augmentation).  
✅ **End-to-End Pipeline** for face landmark detection.  
✅ **Visualization** of detected key points on sample images.
